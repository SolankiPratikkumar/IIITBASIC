* Below there is an IC or processor which is now called as Package QFN 48(Quad Flat No Lead) which is 7mm*7mm area and inside it will communicate with a chip

* This chip is manufactured on a silicon chip called DIE; PADS makes communication with input and output signals and CORE contains all digital logic inside it

* Below is the vital terminology "Foundry IPs" which means a foundry is a factory which manufactures the chip using big machines and IPs an Intellectual Property which is done by communication with the help of files with an organisation. The term "MACROS" performs Digital Operation and consists of pure Digital Logic inside the chip.
