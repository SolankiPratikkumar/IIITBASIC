* C-Program is run by the compile to assembly language of RISC V and that makes Hardware Layout operation (qflow); that Hardware can be RISC-V

***WHAT IS RISC-V***

* RISC-V (pronounced "risk-five") is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) for designing computer processors. 
* An instruction set architecture defines the instructions a processor can execute, the formats for those instructions, and the corresponding hardware behavior. 
* RISC-V is designed to be versatile, customizable, and open, making it well-suited for a wide range of applications, from embedded systems to high-performance computing.
* RISC-V supports both 32-bit and 64-bit address spaces, and it can be implemented with varying levels of performance and complexity, from simple microcontrollers to high-end supercomputers.
